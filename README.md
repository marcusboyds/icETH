### Figma File
The Figma file will be avaliable very soon!

## Opportunity
It was very interesting and cool to study about icETH. Despite all these difficult DeFi terms, we could understand what is going on at ETH staking. We search for apply all the best UX Design for DeFi applications. We would very like to construct this web app to HTML, but the time wasn't enough to show the best yet. 
We have really a lot to show you, and would like to chat better to this project further.

## Thanks
Hope you liked and enjoyed this project, thanks for watching, bye!
